Work done for the NFL DS interview with Swish Analytics


## Assignemnt
The data file contains all plays from the 2021-2023 NFL season(s) and the associated metadata describing the data.

Please review the dataset and start outlining the way you would go about the model-building process with the goal of predicting the probability that the next pass play will result in a sack.

We would like to see you
1. assess the data
2. build a predictive model
3. evaluate that model and the quality of its predictions (with the understanding that delivering predictions with any exceptional lack of error is unlikely in this short time span)

Please provide any associated data analysis (plots, graphs, etc..), feature engineering, and code assembled in the form of a python notebook.
Please include markup text to explain your analysis, graphs, etc.
If you include a notebook, please also add an HTML version of that notebook, to facilitate review.

Data dictionaries for the data can be found here:

This is meant to be an open-ended/creative project, so focus your time where you see best. Most projects are submitted within 7-10 days, but please take the time that you need to show your best work. Please let me know if you have any questions along the way.  Good luck!
